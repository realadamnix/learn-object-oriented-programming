# Learning C++ OOP 

This repository is where I'll document my progress as I learn object-oriented programming in C++. I'll be adding code examples, notes, and mini-projects to solidify my understanding of OOP concepts.

**Goals:**

* Master the core principles of OOP:
    * **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details.
    * **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a class.
    * **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse and establish relationships between objects.
    * **Polymorphism:**  Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.

* Gain proficiency in implementing OOP concepts in C++:
    * Defining classes and objects
    * Working with constructors and destructors
    * Using access modifiers (public, private, protected)
    * Implementing inheritance and polymorphism
    * Understanding abstract classes and interfaces

**Repository Structure:**

* **experiments:**  A place for me to play around with code, try out new concepts, and see how things work.
* **exercises:** Solutions to OOP exercises I find online or in textbooks.
* **projects:** Small projects to apply my OOP skills and build something fun.
* **notes:** My personal notes and explanations of OOP concepts. This will help me reinforce my learning and serve as a quick reference.
